    """
    Sample actions from unnormalized logits and compute associated log-probabilities and entropy.
    `logits` corresponds to a categorical distribution over the full action.
    This function supports either sampling actions from these logits or using externally provided actions.

    Args:
        logits:
            unnormalized logits (pre-softmax)
        action:
            Optional tensor of shape [batch_size] or [batch_size, 1]
            If provided, these actions will be used instead of sampling.

    Returns:
        A tuple of:
        - actions: Tensor of shape [batch_size], sampled or provided
        - joint_logprob: Tensor of shape [batch_size], log-probabilities of selected actions
